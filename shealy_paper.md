Rachel Shealy

## Introduction

Plutarch's collection of essay's _On the Excellence of Women_ includes "The Women of Salamantica". This is a work originally written in Ancient Greek in the 2nd Century BCE. The version of text that I worked with was edited by Frank Cole Babbitt in 1931. [^1]. I am publishing this edition of the "Women of Salamantica" to Plutarch's _On the Excellence of Women_ under an open license, with documentation.

## Plutarch

Mestrius Plutarch, known as Plutarch,  was a Greek philosopher born in 46 C.E. Plutarch was born in the small town of Chaeronea, later becoming a wealthy aristocrat and a leader of the town.  He visited Rome on many occasions and was sponsored as a Roman citizen by Lucius Mestrius Florus, a Roman consul.[^2] Plutarch returned to Greece and served as the senior of two priests of Apollo at the Oracle of Delphi.  Here, he wrote many of his works.  A large number of Plutarch's philosophical writings were lost, however he is remembered for his biographical works as much as his philosophical works. In Plutarch's *Parallel Lives* he "recounts the noble deeds of Greek and Roman soldiers, legislators, orators, and statesmen." [^3]

*Parallel Lives* was originally written in Attic Greek. [^4] Plutarch paired a philosophical biography of a famous Roman with a Greek who was in some way comparable.  Some of Plutarch's more interesting works listed in *Parallel Lives* such as the lives of Hercules and Philip II of Macedon have never been found. Throughout his writings of *Parallel Lives*, Plutarch adds his own ideas about human nature, commenting that he did not write these works for a historical reason, but instead in "exploring the influence of moral character, good or bad, on the lives and destinies of famous men." [^5]

The _Moralia_ holds the remainder of Plutarch's work.  Included in the _Moralia_ is Plutarch's collection of essays, _On the Bravery of Women_, as well as others such as _On the Self-contradictions of the Stoics_, and _On the Common Notions against the Stoics_. (The Stoics, as well as the Epicureans, were philosophical ideas that strongly criticized Plutarch, resulting in Plutarch's response through the _Moralia_.)

## _The Women of Salamantica_

Plutarch's work *On the Excellence of Women,* includes individual women and groups of women who show bravery in the face of obstacles. One of these essays tells the story of the Women of Salamantica.

Plutarch begins the story of the Women of Salamantica by first mentioning Hannibal.  Hannibal Barca was the son of Hamilcar Barca, a leading commander during the First Punic War.  Hannibal himself was a Carthaginian commander during the Second Punic War.  The Punic Wars were a series of three wars between Carthage and Rome and took place over nearly a century.[^6]

Plutarch explains that before fighting the Romans, Hannibal seized a city in Spain called Salamantica and ordered the Spanish to give him six thousand pounds as well as three hundred hostages.  When Hannibal lifted the siege on the city, the people of Salamantica did not give him what he wanted.  In response, Hannibal attacked the city.  

To escape Hannibal's wrath, the people of Salamantica agreed to leave the city with only the clothes they were wearing, leaving all their belongings to Hannibal and his army.  The women knew that Hannibal's soldiers would search the men for weapons but would not search the women. Taking advantage of this, the women hid swords and other weapons in their clothing.  The women were able to give the men the weapons while they were not being watched.  The men and some women then attacked their guards and fled the city.

Hannibal sent men in pursuit of them and caught the people who could not keep up.  The ones who escaped fled to the mountains and sent a petition to Hannibal.  Eventually, the people of Salamantica were able to return to their city and received immunity.

The women used their intelligence and the guards' lack of to help free themselves from Hannibal's soldiers.  The women knew that the soldiers would underestimate them, and they took advantage of the situation. Plutarch recognized the women for their bravery and noted it in this collection of essays.
