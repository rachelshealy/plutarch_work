# FYW Final Paper

Rachel Shealy

## Introduction


This semester in my FYW class I learned many things involving text editing and digital writing.  Some of the things I learned were part of a bigger picture and others were more specific.  One broader thing I learned was how github works as a collaborative entitiy.  The small, more specific things I learned were more editing tips for my writing, and how to make a corpus.

When I first found out I was in this class I did not know what to expect because I was not really sure what "Digital Reading Digital Writing" included, but I am glad I had the opportunity to take the class.  I probably would not have discovered the text editor programs or scala otherwise, and I am glad it gave me something else to learn and maybe talk about one day.  

## Content

One of the first topics we discussed in the class was what a text editor is and how it differs from a word processor.  As someone who had never heard of a text editor, I was very interested in learning more about it.  After reading Cottrell's thoughts and reflecting through the class, I agree with his opinion that word processors can cause a writer to become less focused on the content he is writing.  In the beginning I was doubtful that I would enjoy typing in a word processor but after finding out first hand how simple it is to type in I began to enjoy it more.  

Not only did I learn about word processors versus text editors but I also learned details about the text editors.  For instance, I learned that the "language" used in Atom is called scala and that Atom, my computer terminal, and github are all connected, which I found very interesting.  I also thought it was very cool how github can be used to collaborate with multiple people on ideas and publications.

In this class I also learned how to make a corpus, which I thought was very interesting, even though I did not know what it was until the day we began to make it.  I learned that a corpus basically means a body of text in scala.  We added a corpus to our file titled "editing_notes.md" that consisted of a lot of Strings. We then typed in our terminals and it responded to what we wrote in the text editor, which was really cool to me. By doing this, we also learned a very important lesson, which is to always save our work as we type! More than once, this was the problem we discovered that we had.  Now I will be more aware in the future to save my notes and papers as I write them.

I also learned a lot about Plutarch and his writing on "The Women of Salamantica" through the research essay I wrote.  Writing this essay not only gave me knowledge about Plutarch and his work that other people would not normally have, but I also learned editing tips while I wrote it.  I had never used footnotes or endnotes or anything similar to them in a paper before and using them for the essay we wrote in class clarified how to properly use them.  I learned how to correctly format them and what I could do to make them better.  This was very helpful for me to learn because I will definitely be using footnotes and endnotes in future papers while at Furman.  While writing and reviewing this paper I discovered that I tend to introduce a topic, write something else, and then go back to the first topic. I did not notice that I did this and now that I am aware I find that I often have to go back in my writing to correct this mistake.

## Conclusion
I am very glad that I was placed in this FYW class because it is something that I would not have chosen for myself.  I enjoyed learning new things and also being challenged to write about topics I had no interest in before the class.  In the class we wrote a research paper and presented in front of our classmates which is what I was hoping to get from my FYW.  We also had discussions about the articles and topics from previous classes that helped me to understand what we were talking about and how it was all related.  This FYW was definitely a good one for me to take and I enjoyed being in a class that expanded my knowledge.
